			<h3>Largest Play Ground</h3>	
			<p>While a playground would not be a substitute for real mental health services, some
				members of the student body would find a playground useful in negating stress before their
				problem expand to the point of requiring counseling and support services. Additionally, a
				playground may prove therapeutic for students already involved in the mental health program.
				Such a simple addition to the NBU campus would show that NBU is interested in improving all
				aspects of student's NBU experience.</p>
